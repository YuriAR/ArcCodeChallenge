No special build instructions needed. This project was developed using Android Studio.



Third-party libraries used:

## - GSON:

Used to parse JSON objects coming from the API endpoints.



## - Volley:

Used in all HTTP API requests in the app.



## - RxAndroid:

Used throughout the App to help write cleaner and simpler code (mainly inside the presenters) and help manage background/main thread operations.
